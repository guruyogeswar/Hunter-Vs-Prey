# Hunter-Vs-Prey
Itâ€™s a game where you play as the Hunter, aiming to catch the Prey before it collects all the randomly spawned targets. The environment includes agents, targets, and ray sensors for vision. Rewards and penalties apply to both the Prey and the Hunter. Python 3.8.10 is used for development.
